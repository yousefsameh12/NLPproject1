Requirements to Run the Notebooks
1) Python

Version: Python 3.8 or higher.

Where to get it: python.org
.

Notes: Codespaces already includes Python, so you don’t need to install it there.

2) Required Python Packages

These packages handle text processing, tokenization, and optional POS tagging.

Basic Packages

These are enough for word/token analysis, pronouns, and simple -ly adverb counting:

pip install pandas notebook

Optional (for advanced linguistic analysis with spaCy)

Use spaCy for more accurate verb/adverb detection:

pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


pandas → optional, useful for tables and data analysis.

notebook → required to run Jupyter notebooks.

spacy → advanced NLP library.

en_core_web_sm → small English model for spaCy.

3) Folder Structure

Your repository should look like this:

NLPproject1/
 ├─ data/
 │   ├─ HumanNature.txt
 │   └─ Power.txt
 ├─ notebooks/
 │   ├─ adverbs.ipynb
 │   └─ genderlanguage.ipynb
 └─ ... (other repo files)


The notebooks reference the books using relative paths, e.g., ../data/HumanNature.txt.

Make sure filenames exactly match what the code expects (case-sensitive).

4) Running the Notebooks

Open your .ipynb notebook in Codespaces or Jupyter.

Make sure the kernel is set to Python 3.

Run the cells from top to bottom.

Tip: If you see ModuleNotFoundError, it means the required package isn’t installed. Use pip install <package> in the terminal.

5) Recommended: Use a Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment keeps project dependencies isolated:

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1     # Windows PowerShell

# Upgrade pip and install packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas notebook spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

6) Quick Verification

After setup:

ls ../data


You should see:

HumanNature.txt  Power.txt


Now your notebooks will run without FileNotFoundError or missing modules.
